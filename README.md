# Data Analysis Case Study
The following data analysis case study is a capstone project as a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate
(via Coursera).

This capstone project covered the 6 phases of the data analysis process :

    1.The Ask Phase
Understanding the business task, which in this case study is about finding out the differences between Cyclistic's         casual riders and Cyclistic's annual members in order to improve the casual-to-member conversion rate.
    
    
    2.The Prepare Phase
The data I've worked with is from the divvy-bikes website (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
In this case study I used the last 12 months gathered data (May 2021 - April 2022) so I downloaded the 12 relevant        .csv files of the described time period.
The data was originally organized as "wide data" and I kept in that way since it made more sense to, when taking           into consideration the more convinient visibilty of each of the inspected attributes (one per column) needed for           this analysis later on. 
    
    
    3.The Process Phase
During this phase I've inspected the data for any missing values, typos, illogical values, etc.
In some cases this data cleaning process took longer than others, but eventually the data was properly cleaned and        it was organized altogether in one single data frame that included the entire data from the last 12 months.
The specific steps taken during this phase are described in both the attached slideshow and in the .R file with the       relevant comments describing each step that was taken.
    
    
    4.The Analyze Phase
During this phase I have used some of the recommended commands for the descriptive analysis, and created some more        commands of aspects that seems more important in my opinion for this case study purposes.
The insights, trends and important messages that I found to have a crucial role in the data story-telling are             displayed in the slideshow using both the plots created by R's ggplot2 package and Tableau public in a complling and       easy-to-understand form.
    
    
    5.The Share Phase
As mentioned in the previous phase's description, the vizualizations were created using both R's ggplot2 package and       Tableau public in order to support the important insights from the analysis and improving the data story-telling in       the slideshow.

NOTE: During this case study I did not created a dashboard or any other kind of a dynamic visualization, Since the        data the analysis relied on was fixated on the previous 12 months period I've only used Tableau public in order to         create static visualizations (I've added them to the slideshow as screenshots)
    
    
    6.The Act Phase
The slideshow contains the recommendations and key takeaways for the future of Cyclistic's marketing strategy and         also the points where, in my opinion, worth a more comprehensive examination in case of conducting a deeper analysis       about this data population (Casual riders VS. Annual members)
